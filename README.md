**Glitch images** are visual elements that appears in both my favorite PC game *Cyberpunk 2077* and the movie *Blade Runner 2049*. In cyberpunk style works, artists and designers often use this kind of visual effect to represent neon lights and electronic elements. It's actually a form of new media art called **glitch art**. It originated from **"errors"** in early hardware (video signals), such as bad connections. It's interesting to mix these **"errors"** into paintings as it breaks traditional visual elements and adds a digital, random feeling that will create strong contrast.
